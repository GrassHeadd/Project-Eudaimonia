# Project Eudaemonia
By: Yin Zi and Junjie  
Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11  
  
## Project Scope
Create a simulation of scenarios where users can interact with their biophobias at psuedo reality level to act as a branch to aid them in overcoming their biophobias eventually  

## OVERVIEW
Welcome to the Project Eudaemonia! This project creates an immersive environment where players can interact with animals in various ways within a detailed setting. This README provides an overview of the features, setup instructions, and other essential information.

## FEATURES
Features 1 (core): Interactive mechanisms including movement, grabbing, swinging and throwing, enabling players to interact with a variety of animals through intuitive VR controls  

Feature 2 (core): Dynamic environment to represent scenarios where the user will interact with the insects by doing tasks in a location that simulates realistic environmental conditions  

Feature 3 (core): Multiple different levels with different animals for the users to choose from catering to what their biophobia is, and customise the level they can accept  

Feature 4 (core): Boss fights to make the game more interesting and fun, bringing a competitive factor on top of overcoming their phobia  

Feature 5 (extension): Subconsciously integrate information that teaches players about animal biology and behaviour to let users familiarise with the insects subconsciously, removing the fear factor(e.g if you don’t step on snakes they won’t bother you)  

Feature 6 (extension): Integrate music to the game to make it more realistic  

Feature 7 (extension): Integrate the use of interactive equipment and resources for the user to make use of in the game to interact with the objects, contributing to the interactiveness and realistic factor of exploring the scenes  

Feature 8 (extension): Sounds integrated to provide a more realistic and enjoyable experience for the user   


### Installation:
  To get started with the Spider Interaction Unity Project, follow these steps:  
    1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/GrassHeadd/Project-Eudaimonia.git  
    2. Open in Unity  
       - Launch Unity Hub  
       - Click on the "add" button  
       - Select the cloned repository folder to open the project in Unity  
       - Might need to enable the XR Device Simulator Asset on the Hierarchy(left side of screen)  
         - right click and select toggle active status, name should light up  
         - repeat the steps for all scenes by going to Projects on the bottom  
         - select Projects folder, followed by scenes and repeat for each scene(Death, Forest, LivingRoom, Start)  
    (continue below for testing with VR Headset(Meta Quest), turn off XR Device Simulator if on'd the previous time)  
    3. Download Meta Quest Developer Hub and create an account/log into your meta quest account  
    4. In unity, press files -> build settings -> platform android -> build  
    5. Upon finish building, move the apk file to Meta Quest Developer Hub  
    6. On Meta Quest, go to applications and display apps from unknown sources  
    7. Open the game and start playing!  
    
### Controls for VR simulator(only works for windows unfortunately):
  - check the hirerachy tab in unity to see if XR Device Simulator is lit up and enabled, if not, right click it and press toggle active status to enable it  
  - repeat the process for all the scenes by going to the projects tab at the bottom, navigate to the project folder, then scenes folder, and repeat the process for all the scenes(those that are not folders)
  - go to start scene by double clicking the start scene object
  - run the game by pressing the |> button at the middle top of your screen
  - all available controls will be displayed on the screen

### Controls for VR Headset:
  - top button for selection
  - turning head or right controller for movement of vision
  - actually moving and left controlled for movement of body
  - side button of the controller for grab function 

### Requirements:
  Unity Version: This project is developed with Unity version 2022.3.8f1. Ensure you have this version or a later version installed  
  Dependencies: No additional dependencies are required for this project
  Target Device: Meta Oculus Device (Quest or Rift)
